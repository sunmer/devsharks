# Devsharks

This app showcases a service where developers sign up for doing code reviews, and are then matched with companies who need them.

The code showcases the Vue stack when built with TypeScript. Everything is neatly containerised and shows how to write clean and modular code which is simple to debug.

Concepts which are fully implemented are AJAX requests via Axios,
VUE template files, form validation via Vee-Validate, dummy JWT authentication
and hot reloading via Webpack.
